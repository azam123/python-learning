**Data Types:**
**Integer:** Whole numbers.
**Float:** Numbers with decimals.
**Complex:** Numbers with a real and imaginary part.
**String:** Sequence of characters.
**Boolean:** Logical values (True or False).
**List:** Ordered and mutable collection.
**Tuple:** Ordered but immutable collection.
**Set:** Unordered collection of unique elements.
**Dictionary:** Key-value pairs.
**None:** Represents the absence of a value.
**Bytes:** Immutable sequence of bytes.
**Bytearray:** Mutable sequence of bytes.
**Range:** Represents a sequence of numbers.
**Frozenset:** Immutable version of a set.


**Conditional Statements:**
**if:** Executes a block of code if the condition is True.
**if-else:** Executes one block if the condition is True and another if itâ€™s False.
**if-elif-else:** Handles multiple conditions.
**Nested if:** Checks conditions within another condition.
**Logical operators (and, or):** Combine multiple conditions.
**Shorthand if:** Allows concise conditional expressions.
**pass:** Placeholder when no action is required.


**Loops:**
**For Loop (List Iteration):** The for loop iterates over each item in the list fruits and prints them.
**For Loop (Range):** The range(1, 6) generates numbers from 1 to 5, and the loop iterates through each number to print it.
**While Loop:** This loop continues as long as the condition (counter <= 5) is True, printing numbers from 1 to 5.
**Nested Loops:** The outer for loop runs from 1 to 3, and for each iteration, the inner for loop runs from 1 to 3, printing a multiplication table.
**Break Statement:** The break statement exits the loop when i equals 6.
**Continue Statement:** The continue statement skips the current iteration when i equals 3 and moves to the next iteration.
